Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and <br /> other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes <br /> only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by <br /> copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before <br /> applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors <br /> should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. <br /> More considerations for licensors.


Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and <br /> conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not <br /> regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed <br /> material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, <br /> such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
